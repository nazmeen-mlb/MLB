## Understanding Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time

- What is Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time?

- An Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time test is a screening test that helps evaluate your body's ability to form blood clots. This test is performed to detect bleeding disorders if you have unexplained bleeding or bruising and to monitor ongoing treatment with anticoagulant medicines.

Clotting factors or coagulation factors, are the proteins found in the blood that help to stop bleeding whenever there is a wound or cut. When any blood vessel is ruptured, the clotting factors initiate the formation of a blood clot that stops the bleeding rapidly. But when there is insufficient clotting factor in the blood, the blood clots do not form well, which leads to excessive bleeding.

An Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) also known as partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is performed to check if you have problems associated with your clotting factors which can result in excessive blood loss. This test helps diagnose various bleeding disorders, such as hemophilia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), antiphospholipid syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), etc. Your doctor may also suggest an Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time test if you have symptoms of bleeding or clotting disorders, such as unexplained and inappropriate heavy bleeding, easy bruising, unusual heavy nose bleeds, leg swelling, redness on the legs, or chest pain. Additionally, this test is performed in case of recurrent miscarriages and sometimes before a scheduled surgery.

Usually, overnight fasting (8-12 hours) is preferred before an Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time test, and a duly filled coagulation requisition form is mandatory for sample collection. If you take anticoagulant medication, it is advised to give the testing sample before the daily dose is taken. Also, inform the doctor if you are taking medications such as blood thinners, as they may interfere with test results, and your doctor may adjust your dose or stop them temporarily before the test.

Test result ranges are approximate and may differ slightly between different labs depending on the methodology and laboratory guidelines. Talk to your doctor about your specific test results. Narrate your as well as your family’s complete medical history of bleeding disorders to help the doctor correlate your clinical and laboratory findings. After analyzing all the aPTT test results, the doctor would recommend a course of treatment and lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to manage your condition.

What is Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time used for?
An Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time test is done:

To detect and diagnose bleeding disorders or clotting disorders.

Before planning a surgical procedure.

To monitor the efficacy of the treatment with anticoagulant medications, such as warfarin and heparin.

If there are symptoms like easy bruising, excessive or unexplained bleeding, etc.

In conditions that may affect the blood’s clotting ability such as liver disease, lack of vitamin K, blood transfusion, cancer, and autoimmune disorders.

To investigate the cause of thrombotic episodes or recurrent miscarriages.
